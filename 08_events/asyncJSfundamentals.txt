Javascript ->    (1) Synchronous       -> The JavaScript engine executes our program sequentially, one line at a time from top to bottom in the exact order of the statements.

                 (2) Single Threaded   -> Single threaded means that only one command or task is processed at a time


Execution Context -> 
                (1) Execute one line of code at each time
                (2) Console log->1
                (3) Console log->2

                Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing


Blocking Code vs Non-Blocking Code::>
 

Blocking Code-> Block the flow of Program --> Read File Sync
Non-Blocking Code-> Does not block execution --> Read File ASYNC
